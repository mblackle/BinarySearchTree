PROJECT TITLE: String Binary Search Tree
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This program allows the user to enter and search for strings. When the strings are added to the tree, they are wrapped inside a node object that holds the string, the frequency (number of times) with which that string has been added to the tree, and references to the two other nodes (children) and are added to the Binary Search Tree.
